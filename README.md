# SwiftUI_ImageCropper
## Introduction
This is a simple cropper of images using SwiftUI. So you can customize the cropper easily and crop image in iOS/iPadOS even in macOS.

I make a demo in iOS/iPadOS to help you know how it works, and it also shows the size of image in pixel. 
It will show an image I inputted in advance. Then you can crop it in your mind, and touch the symbol "crop". The cropped image will show!
It works like below in iPhone and iPad:

You can follow the Usage to take SwiftUI_ImageCropper into your app or project! Enjoy it!

### Step 2
Then you can use following code to call it in any View:
```
CropperView(inputImage: UIImage, croppedImage: Binding<UIImage>, cropBorderColor: Color?, cropVerticesColor: Color, cropperOutsideOpacity: Double)
```

There are some parameters for you to customize or use the cropper(**If you want more, please "issue" me**):

| Parameter             | Type             | Default            | Description |
| -----------           | -----------      | -----------        | ----------- | 
| inputImage            | UIImage          | You must assign it | Image you want to be cropped |
| croppedImage          | Binding<UIImage> | You must assign it | The cropped image(it need you create a UIImage first), you can show or save it |
| cropBorderColor       | Color?           | Color.white        | As name said, it control the color of border of cropper |
| cropVerticesColor     | Color            | Color.pink         | As name said, it control the color of Vertices of cropper |
| cropperOutsideOpacity | Double           | 0.4                | The opacity of dark mask out of cropper |
